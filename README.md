# insta2blog
Create your blog post right from instagram.

## How will it work?

Every time you create a post on instagram, we will create the same post as a blog for you.

### That's neat, but why?

Targeted towards small businesses of 1-4 people, we understand how hard it is to generate content on multiple platforms.

The reason most people maintain blog is to have a higher ranking on SEO on Google. But when your main work is on instagram, *no matter how many posts you have,* you won't rank high on google Search, in fact you may never show up when people search for your keywords.

Thats a problem. 

Maintain an Instagram account is much easier when compared to a blog, we are offer you a service to you where we create blog posts for you, and redirect visitors to your relevent sites.
